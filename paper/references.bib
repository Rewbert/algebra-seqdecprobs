  year =         2010,
  abstract =     {This paper is concerned with testing properties of
                  polymorphic functions. The problem is that testing
                  can only be performed on specific monomorphic
                  instances, whereas parametrically polymorphic
                  functions are expected to work for any type. We
                  present a schema for constructing a monomorphic
                  instance for a polymorphic property, such that
                  correctness of that single instance implies
                  correctness for all other instances. We also give a
                  formal definition of the class of polymorphic
                  properties the schema can be used for. Compared to
                  the standard method of testing such properties, our
                  schema leads to a significant reduction of necessary
                  test cases.},

                  theory of policy advice and avoidability. More
                  specifically, we formalize a cluster of notions
                  related to policy advice, such as policy, viability,
                  reachability, and propose a novel approach for
                  assisting decision making, based on the concept of
                  avoidability. We formalize avoidability as a
                  relation between current and future states,
                  investigate under which conditions this relation is
                  decidable and propose a generic procedure for
                  assessing avoidability. The formalization is
                  constructive and makes extensive use of the
                  correspondence between dependent types and logical
                  propositions, decidable judgments are obtained
                  through computations. Thus, we aim for a
                  computational theory, and emphasize the role that
                  computer science can play in global system science.}

  abstract =     {Dependent type theories have a long history of being
                  used for theorem proving. One aspect of type theory
                  which makes it very powerful as a proof language is
                  that it mixes deduction with computation. This also
                  makes type theory a good candidate for
                  programming---the strength of the type system allows
                  properties of programs to be stated and established,
                  and the computational properties provide semantics
                  for the programs. This thesis is concerned with
                  bridging the gap between the theoretical
                  presentations of type theory and the requirements on
                  a practical programming language. Although there are
                  many challenging research problems left to solve
                  before we have an industrial scale programming
                  language based on type theory, this thesis takes us
                  a good step along the way.},

                  example mobile applcations communicating with a
                  central server, distributed systems coordinaing a
                  telecommunications network, or concurrent systems
                  handling events and processes in a desktop
                  application. However, reasoning about concurrent
                  prgrams is hard, since we must reason about each
                  process and the order in which communication might
                  happen between processes. In this paper, I describe
                  a type-driven approach to implementing communicating
                  concurrent programs, using the dependently typed
                  programming language Idris. I show how the type
                  system can be used to describe resource access
                  protocols (such as controlling access to a file
                  handle) and verify that programs correctly follow
                  those prtools. Finally, I show how to use the type
                  system to reason about the order of communication
                  between concurrent processes, ensuring that each end
                  of a communication channel follows a defined
                  protocol.},

  abstract =	 {I was invited to give a talk at a celebration of the
                  80th birthday of Richard Palais. It was at a
                  celebration of his 60th birthday that I first gave a
                  talk about how to write a proof--a talk that led to
                  [101]. So, I thought it would be fun to give the
                  same talk, updated to reflect my 20 years of
                  experience writing structured proofs. The talk was
                  received much more calmly than my earlier one, and
                  the mathematicians were open to considering that I
                  might have something interesting to say about
                  writing proofs. Perhaps in the last 20 years I have
                  learned to be more persuasive, or perhaps the
                  mathematicians in the audience had just grown older
                  and calmer. In any case, they were still not ready
                  to try changing how they write their own proofs.
                  My experience preparing and giving the talk made me
                  realize it was time for a new paper on the
                  subject. This paper is built around a simple
                  example--a lemma from Michael Spivak's calculus
                  text. I tried to show how a mathematician can easily
                  transform the proofs she now writes into structured
                  proofs. The paper also briefly describes how formal
                  structured proofs are written in TLA+, and an
                  appendix contains a machine-checked proof of
                  Spivak's lemma. While mathematicians will not write
                  formal proofs in the forseeable future, I argue that
                  learning how to write them is a good way to learn
                  how to write rigorous informal proofs.},
